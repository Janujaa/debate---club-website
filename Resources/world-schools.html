      <h2>WSD — Quick overview</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">World Schools Debate combines prepared motions and impromptu motions in a 3v3 format. It emphasizes persuasive case-building, clear clash, and effective rebuttal across three main speakers and a reply speaker.</p>

      <h3>Format & speaking order</h3>
      <ul class="note">
        <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Government (or Proposition) vs Opposition</li>
        <li><strong>Speakers per team:</strong> 3 main speakers + 1 reply speaker (team member)</li>
        <li><strong>Usual speaking order:</strong>
          <ol class="note">
            <li>1st Government — Prime Minister (Constructive case)</li>
            <li>1st Opposition — Leader of Opposition (Constructive + rebuttal)</li>
            <li>2nd Government — Deputy Prime Minister (build & rebut)</li>
            <li>2nd Opposition — Deputy Leader (build & rebut)</li>
            <li>3rd Government — Government Whip (summary & clash)</li>
            <li>3rd Opposition — Opposition Whip (summary & clash)</li>
            <li>Reply speeches — usually 3 minutes each (often by 1st speaker of each team or designated reply speaker).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Speaker roles & duties</h3>

      <h4>Prime Minister (1st Gov)</h4>
      <p class="subtitle">Presents the government’s case, defines the motion (if applicable), and sets out team line and key arguments.</p>

      <h4>Leader of Opposition (1st Opp)</h4>
      <p class="subtitle">Responds to the government case, offers a counter-case or rebuttal, and frames the clash for the round.</p>

      <h4>Deputy Prime / Deputy Leader</h4>
      <p class="subtitle">Develops team's case further, answers opponent arguments, and strengthens the team's comparative advantages.</p>

      <h4>Whips (3rd speakers)</h4>
      <p class="subtitle">Provide concise summaries, weigh impacts, and crystallise the clash — avoid new major arguments.</p>

      <h4>Reply speaker</h4>
      <p class="subtitle">3-minute summary from each side (depends on tournament rules). Focus on weighing and decision cues for judges.</p>

    <section style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <h3>Timings (common example)</h3>
      <ul class="note">
        <li>Main speeches: 7 minutes each</li>
        <li>Reply speeches: 3–4 minutes each (often 3)</li>
        <li>Preparation time between rounds: variable (often 30–60 minutes); some motions are impromptu with short prep</li>
        <li>Points of Information: allowed after first minute and before last minute (standard convention)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <h3>Judging criteria</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">Common judging rubric used in WSD:</p>
      <ul class="note">
        <li><strong>Matter:</strong> quality of ideas, evidence, and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Manner:</strong> clarity, engagement, delivery and persuasiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> structure, organization, and how well speakers clash and weigh impacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Strategy & Clash:</strong> degree of comparative analysis; judges should be able to see why one team outweighs the other.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subtitle">Judges typically rank teams and award speaker points — ensure speakers give clear decision cues and comparative impacts.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <h3>Adjudicator guidance (quick)</h3>
      <ul class="note">
        <li>Identify the central clash (the key issue that decides the round).</li>
        <li>Look for clear weighing by teams — which arguments change the outcome and why.</li>
        <li>Distinguish between new arguments and extensions — allow minor extensions but penalise major new arguments in reply/whip.</li>
        <li>Balance matter and manner — an idea poorly delivered can still be important if the speaker explains its impacts succinctly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <h3>Practical strategy tips</h3>
      <ul class="note">
        <li><strong>For Governments:</strong> set a manageable definition, structure the case into 2–3 clear pillars, and pre-empt obvious opposition responses.</li>
        <li><strong>For Opposition:</strong> focus on strong clash and impact comparison; consider offering a clear counter-model if it helps weigh impacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Whips & Replies:</strong> prioritise crystallisation and weighing over new evidence; judges need clear decision cues.</li>
        <li><strong>POIs:</strong> use POIs to expose contradictions and to force opponents to clarify; accept strategically, not every time.</li>
      </ul>
